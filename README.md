# Exploring-Python
A place to put all the mini-projects I work on as I learn.

<strong>MyFirstProgram:</strong> Plays a game where the user has to correctly guess a randomly generated number. Took a while to finish because I kept getting tangled up in all the if/elif/else structures. 

<strong>lovetester:</strong> Takes two names and outputs a percentage by assigning values to the letters in the names. My first time opening and closing files in a program.
